Business notes:

1)Maybe the parameter of No of bedrooms should be better defined.It is a little bit confusing
with all these bullets since the requirement is that only a house with zero to four bedrooms
can be insured
2)Product owner should refer a link with the valid post codes of UK area so as to have a reference of
valid and invalid post codes.Same logic with the post codes for subsidence area and for area in flood risk.

Technical notes:

HouseInsuranceService:
1)Changed the signature of getCalculatedPremium method from int to BigDecimal 
because the amount can be 126.50 not only int.
2)added a private method to calculate the amount based on flood risk.
3)The message of "Not available insurance" is logged accordingly.
4)Null postcode is considered as an exceptional case.

FloodAreaChecker:
1)Made the assumption that(due to missing requirements of the post codes of flood risk areas):
   High flood risk area post codes begin with "H"
   Medium flood risk area post codes begin with "M"
   Low flood risk area post codes begin with "L"
2)A new method isPostcodeValid is created in order to check if the post code follows UK post code patterns.

SubsidenceAreaChecker:
1)Made the assumption that(due to missing requirements of the post codes of subsidence area):
   Subsidence are post  codes begin with "S"
